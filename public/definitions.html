              <div class="indent-block">
                <img src="img/DownArrow.png" class="arrow"> The appropriate ranking for this company may be lower than the ranking shown because the company excluded some emissions from its report.<br>

            </div><br>

            <span class="large bold-header">Intensity Ranking.</span> The “intensity” of GHG emissions is their amount divided by some measure of the company’s production. Here, the measure of production is the company’s revenues.<br>
            <div class="indent-block">
              <span class="bold-header">Rank.</span> The company’s rank based on Scope 1+2/Revenues. The company with the lowest ratio of emissions to revenues is ranked “1.”<br>

              <span class="bold-header">Scope 1+2/Revenues.</span> The total of scope 1 and scope 2 emissions reported by the company divided by the revenues reported by the company.<br>
            </div><br>

            <span class="large bold-header">In-industry Ranking.</span> A ranking of companies against other companies in the same industry. The ranking here is based on total scope 1 and scope 2 emissions reported.<br>
            <div class="indent-block">
              <span class="bold-header">Industry.</span> The debtor’s primary industry.  The industry categories are those defined by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).<br>
              <span class="bold-header">Rank.</span> The company’s rank based on Scope 1+2 emissions, among the companies in the same industry. The company with the lowest ratio of emissions to revenues is ranked “1.”<br><br>
            </div>

            <span class="large bold-header">EPA Emissions Ranking.</span> EPA emissions rankings are based on raw data mandatorily submitted by major emitting facilities to the EPA.<br>
            <div class="indent-block">
              <span class="bold-header">Rank.</span> The company’s rank based on EPA Scope 1 emissions. We ranked all 70 companies with zero EPA Scope 1 emissions as tied for first.<br>
              <span class="bold-header">Scope 1.</span> Direct emissions reported by facilities to the EPA and for which the company was listed as the “parent company.”  Only 132 of the S&P 500 companies were listed as parent companies.  The EPA data did not link the remaining 368 companies to any emissions. We recorded the absence of such a link as zero EPA Scope 1 emissions. That is, we assumed that facilities complied with the law in reporting their emissions and the identities of their parent companies.<br>
              <span class="bold-header">Rank by ratio.</span> The company’s rank based on its ratio of EPA Scope 1 emissions to revenues (Scope 1/Revenues). We ranked all 70 companies with zero emissions as tied for first.<br>
              <span class="bold-header">Scope 1/Revenues.</span> The total of scope 1 emissions reported to the EPA by emitting facilities for which the company was listed as a parent company, divided by the company’s revenues.<br>

            Sample: 200 randomly selected S&P 500 companies<br>
            Data: From voluntary GHG reports and mandatory EPA reports.<br><br>

            <span class="large bold-header">GHG Information Reported</span><br>
            <div class="indent-block">
              <span class="bold-header">Scope 1+2 emissions.</span> “yes” if the company reported scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, “no” if the company did not.  We added “exclusions” to the “yes” entries if the company reported omitting one or more categories of those emissions from its reported measurements and did not report that the omissions were de minimis.<br>
              <span class="bold-header">Scope 3 emissions.</span> “yes” if the company reported at least one category of Scope 3 emissions, “no” if the company did not.<br>
              <span class="bold-header">Biogenic emissions.</span> “yes” if the company reported a number for its biogenic emissions, “no” if the company did not.<br>
              <span class="bold-header">Firm boundary.</span> The method used by the company to determine whether emissions are inside the firm and reportable or outside the firm and not reportable. These methods are defined in the GHG Protocol.<br>
              <span class="bold-header">Equity share.</span> A company accounts for GHG emissions from operations according to its share of equity in the operations. The economic substance of the relationship the company has with the operations always overrides the legal ownership form to ensure that equity share reflects the percentage of economic interest
              <span class="bold-header">Financial control.</span> The control is financial if the company is able to direct the financial and operating policies of the emitter with a view to gaining economic benefits from its activities.<br>
              <span class="bold-header">Operational control.</span> The control is operational if the company or one of its subsidiaries has the full authority to introduce and implement its operating policies at the emitter.<br>
              <span class="bold-header">Other boundary.</span> Other boundaries adopted by the reporting companies.<br>
              <span class="bold-header">No GHG Report.</span> The company did not issue a GHG Report for 2020.<br>
              <span class="bold-header">No boundary data.</span> The company issued a GHG Report for 2020, but the report did not identify the boundary employed.<br>
              <span class="bold-header">GWP assessment.</span> A Global Warming Potential (GWP) assessment is a determination by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) or some other authority of the ratios that companies should use in converting emissions of greenhouse gases other than CO2 to CO2 equivalents (CO2-e). The IPCC has made five assessments over time and the EPA has made its own assessments.<br>

            <div class="indent-block">
              <span class="bold-header">10-K, CSR & GHG are calendar year.</span> Whether the company reports financial, CSR, and GHG data on a calendar year basis. This field is “yes” if all three reports are on a calendar year; “no” if any of the three reports is no on a calendar year. Reports are “calendar year” if they cover the period from the beginning of January to the end of December 2020.  Reports are calendar year if the covered period started before January 15 and ended after December 15. Calendar year reports are most comparable to those of other companies because most companies report on a calendar year.<br>
              <span class="bold-header">Days to GHG release.</span> The number of days from the end of the period covered by the company’s greenhouse gas report until the greenhouse gas report was made public.<br>
            </div><br>

            <!--<span class="large bold-header">CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) Report.</span> “yes” means the company made public a CSR Report for the year 2020, “no” means it did not. We define a CSR report as a document or a website that reports data on at least one of the subjects of reporting under the GRI or SASB protocols. The report must contain numeric data. “We are reducing our GHG emissions” is not a report.  The report must be for some fixed time period. “We’ve reduced our emissions by more than 32%” is not a CSR Report if it states no period of coverage. A CDP questionnaire that is available free on the internet is a CSR report if it meets the forgoing requirements. Titling a report a “Corporate Responsibility Report” or “Sustainability Report” does not make it one. “download” is a permalink to the company’s 2020 CSR Report (the company’s copy). The Stakeholder Takeover Project maintains a second copy (the project’s copy) on which we have highlighted the data we extracted. The project copies will be posted on a separate page of this website.<br>-->

            <span class="large bold-header">GHG (Greenhouse Gas) Report.</span> “yes” means the company made public a GHG Report for the year 2020, “no” means it did not. We define a GHG report as a document or a website that reports scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions, even if they are undifferentiated. “download” is a permalink to the company’s 2020 GHG Report (the company’s copy).<br><br>
